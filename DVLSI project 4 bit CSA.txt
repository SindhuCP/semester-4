DVLSI project: 4 bit CSA

->invented by John von Neumann

->The carry-save unit consists of n full adders(parallel ensemble), each of which computes a single sum and carry bit based solely on the corresponding bits of the three input numbers.

->A carry-save adder is a type of digital adder, used to efficiently compute the sum of three or more binary numbers.

->It differs from other digital adders in that it outputs two (or more) numbers, and the answer of the original summation can be achieved by adding these outputs together.

applications: 
--> A carry save adder is typically used in a binary multiplier, since a binary multiplier involves addition of more than two binary numbers after multiplication. 
--> A big adder implemented using this technique will usually be much faster than conventional addition of those numbers.

why is carry look ahead not useful:
A carry look-ahead adder can reduce the delay. In principle the delay can be reduced so that it is proportional to logâ€¯n, but for large numbers this is no longer the case, because even when carry look-ahead is implemented, the distances that signals have to travel on the chip increase in proportion to n, and propagation delays increase at the same rate. 
For example: Once we get to the 512-bit to 2048-bit number sizes that are required in public-key cryptography, carry look-ahead is not of much help.

drawbacks:
We still do not know whether the result of the addition is larger or smaller than a given number (for instance, we do not know whether it is positive or negative).

->This above point is a drawback when using carry-save adders to implement modular multiplication (multiplication followed by division, keeping the remainder only)
